        "\n",
        "2. 📝 **Input for Evaluation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Generated text (candidate output).\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Source: Dialog history.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - Relevant context (basically, the \"ground truth\").\n",
        "\n",
        "3. 📊 **Scoring Across Dimensions:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   -  Results in individual scores per dimension.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Exact computation process/formulas not detailed in reviewed section.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "We're going to use the `unieval-dialog` model.\n",
        "\n",
        "This model evaluates naturalness, coherence, engagingness, groundedness and understandability for dialogue response generation. Higher scores generally indicate better quality. This applies to metrics such as coherence, consistency, fluency, and relevance, all of which are scored in the range of 0 to 1, with higher scores representing better performance in these dimensions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. 🗣️ **Naturalness:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Measures if text feels human-like.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Score range: 0 to 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. 🔗 **Coherence:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Assesses logical consistency and flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Score range: 0 to 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. 💥 **Engagingness:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Gauges captivation level.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Score range: 0 to +∞.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. 🌍 **Groundedness:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Checks factual and real-world relevance.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Score range: 0 to 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. 📝 **Understandability:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   -  Focuses on clarity and comprehension ease.\n",
        "\n",
        "   -  Score range: 0 to 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "You can take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/maszhongming/UniEval/tree/main/metric) for details on how this works.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Here's an overview of how it works\n",
        "\n",
        "**Scoring Mechanism**:\n",
        "   - Each input is tokenized, and a corresponding \"No\" target is created (though the target content does not affect the score).\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The model predicts logits for each input, which are then separated into \"Yes\" and \"No\" probabilities using the softmax function.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The positive (Yes) and negative (No) scores are extracted for each input.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - For 'engagingness', it calculates a summation score. This involves tokenizing the system output into sentences and scoring each sentence individually, then summing these scores for each sample.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - For 'naturalness', 'coherence', 'groundedness', and 'understandability', it calculates a turn-level score. This involves scoring the entire system output as a single unit for each dimension.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Final Score Calculation**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The final score for each input is calculated as the ratio of the positive score to the sum of positive and negative scores. This gives a score between 0 and 1, where a higher score indicates a higher likelihood of the input being positively evaluated (i.e., a \"Yes\" response).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Handling Boolean QA**:\n",
        "\n",
        " -  The scoring mechanism essentially treats the evaluation as a Boolean QA problem, where the model predicts whether the input text satisfies a given quality dimension (like coherence or naturalness).\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach aligns with the paper's description of formulating multi-dimensional evaluation as a unified Boolean QA problem. The final score reflects the model's confidence in the positive quality of the text for the specific dimension being evaluated."
