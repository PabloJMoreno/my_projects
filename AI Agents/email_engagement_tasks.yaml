email_drafting:
  description: >
    Craft a highly personalized email using the lead's name, job title,
    company information, and any relevant personal or company achievements.
    The email should speak directly to the lead's interests and the needs
    of their company.
    This is not as cold outreach as it is a follow up to a lead form, so
    keep it short and to the point.
    Don't use any salutations or closing remarks, nor too complex sentences.
